6 * Use gem yank to yank (remove) old gems 
         $ gem yank hola_casiano -v 0.0.1

7 * $ cat -n my-gem.gemspec 
     1  # -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
     2  lib = File.expand_path('../lib', __FILE__)
     3  $LOAD_PATH.unshift(lib) unless $LOAD_PATH.include?(lib)
     4  require 'my-gem/version'
     5  
     6  Gem::Specification.new do |gem|
     7    gem.name          = "my-gem"
     8    gem.version       = My::Gem::VERSION
     9    gem.authors       = ["Casiano Rodriguez Leon"]
    10    gem.email         = ["casiano.rodriguez.leon@gmail.com"]
    11    gem.description   = %q{TODO: Write a gem description}
    12    gem.summary       = %q{TODO: Write a gem summary}
    13    gem.homepage      = ""
    14  
    15    gem.files         = `git ls-files`.split($/)
    16    gem.executables   = gem.files.grep(%r{^bin/}).map{ |f| File.basename(f) }
    17    gem.test_files    = gem.files.grep(%r{^(test|spec|features)/})
    18    gem.require_paths = ["lib"]
    19  end

8 * The last step of our initial setup is to ensure that the constant
    and folder names generated by Bundler matches the constant and
    folder names we want to use for our library. 
    In the above gemspec the referenced version is My::Gem::VERSION when I would
    actually want it to be MyGem::VERSION. To change this, I need to
    modify the constant in three places:

            The version reference in the gemspec
            The lib/my-gem.rb file
            The lib/my-gem/version.rb file

    Unless our library is going to be very small, we will usually
    want our base constant (for example MyGem) to be a module, not a
    class. This allows us to easily namespace all of the different
    classes and components of our gem in a simple and sane way.

9 * gem names are almost always delimited with dashes 
   while folder and file names are almost always delimited with underscores. 


   This is partially to make for inferrable mappings from file names to class
   names.
   So if I have a constant called MyGem::VERSION it should be located in 
                      lib/my_gem/version.rb
   even though my gem's name is my-gem.

10 * When Bundler generates our gem (if we have dashes in the name) 
    it creates a folder inside the lib directory of the same name. I
    would recommend modifying this to use underscores in place of dashes.
    To do this, we will need to do the following:

      Rename the directory (e.g. mv lib/my-gem lib/my_gem).
      Alter the first line require in lib/my-gem.rb to use the
        underscored directory name.
      Alter the require in the gemspec file to use the underscored
        directory name.

    Edit the gemspec file and introduce the required modifications:

  $ vi my-gem.gemspec 

11 * By following the community conventions you:

      Make your library easier to "guess" how to use because
      developers can use common idioms to which they have become
      accustomed.

      Make your library auto-requirable by Bundler (which looks
      for the my-gem.rb file and requires it automatically in
      frameworks such as Rails)

      Make your library easier for contributors to join by providing
      familiar patterns and locations for code

12 * When you package up your new rubygem to share with the world, you
    need to be careful with the files you place directly in lib/.
    Rubygems (and almost all other ruby package mangers) will add your
    gem’s lib/ to the load path. This means any file placed in the top
    level of lib/ will be directly requirable by anyone using the gem.

    Bad gem example:

      `-- lib
          |-- foo
          |   `-- cgi.rb
          |-- foo.rb
          |-- erb.rb
          `-- set.rb

    It may seem harmless to call files whatever you’d like in your
    package because you are “namespaced” in your own package. But if
    lib/ is prepended to $LOAD_PATH it will clobber Ruby’s built in erb
    and set libs. require 'erb' would no longer require Ruby’s builtin
    erb library, but this package’s version of it.

    The safe (and correct) way would be to namespace your files under
    another directory. Its conventional to create a folder within lib
    with the same name as your gem. Then we would put all our dependency
    files under lib/foo/ instead of at lib/ root.

    This is sort of a gray area. There is no strict rule that you must
    put all your files under a folder with your package name. It is
    okay to have multiple files at your root lib directory as long as
    you intend for people to require them separately. Namespace internal
    dependency files that you don’t expect for people to require directly.

13 * There are two types of gem dependencies, 
    runtime dependencies and development dependencies. 
    
    Runtime dependencies are libraries that
    your gem needs in order to function. 

    Development dependencies, on the other hand, are gems that are only 
    needed by people who are going to contribute to the code of the gem. 

    Gems are, by default, installed only with the runtime dependencies. 

14 * Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/)

     A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z
     are non-negative integers. 
     X is the major version, 
     Y is the minor version, and 
     Z is the patch version. 
     Each element MUST increase numerically by increments of one. 
     For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.

     '~>' is called "spermy operator"
     "~> 2.3" means "equal to 2.3 or greater than 2.3, but less than 3.0", 
     while "~> 2.3.0" would mean "equal to 2.3.0 or greater than 2.3.0, 
     but less than 2.4.0".
